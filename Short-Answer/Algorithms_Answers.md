#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Its O(n) because the value of ''n'' means how many ops are done. n = operations


b) O(n) since n = 5 , sums to 15.
###### this is on(log)


c) This is too 0(n)

## Exercise II

A binary search algorithm will help to find the highest floor because I will divide by 2 and do the experimentation from the middle. If egg breaks then voila  no need to go higher just lower. So I will repeat to find new middles till the point of no breaking.
